## Important!

This entire branch was made for me to add music to my plex server with no hassle,
It was not made to be customizable, if you are looking for something easy to use
with little configuration needed to be done, go to the [Master Branch](https://github.com/KalebSchmidlkofer/ytdownload/tree/master)!

This branch is used to download youtube videos then send them to a server,
or to start a web-server and take url requests to download
the youtube videos onto a remote server.
